##Find the total consumption for each country in countries for the year 1989
## Following steps: 

##Create an empty dictionary called totals.
##Select only the rows in world_alcohol that match a given year. Assign the result to year.
##Loop through a list of countries. For each country:
##Select only the rows from year that match the given country.
##Assign the result to country_consumption.
##Extract the fifth column from country_consumption.
##Replace any empty string values in the column with the string 0.
##Convert the column to the float data type.
##Find the sum of the column.
##Add the sum to the totals dictionary, with the country name as the key.
##After the code executes, you'll have a dictionary containing all of the country names as keys, with the associated alcohol consumption totals as the values.
